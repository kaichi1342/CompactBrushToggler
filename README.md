## What is Compact Brush Toggler 

*Compact Brush Toggler* is a Python plugin made for [Krita](https://krita.org) (free professional and open-source painting program). 

This plugin allows one access to "Use Pressure Curve" checkboxes, that toggles pressure on/off specific brush property and "Horizontal Brush Fade" Slider , that controls the horizontal fade/blur of the brush, from a smaller docker without opening the Brush Editor.
